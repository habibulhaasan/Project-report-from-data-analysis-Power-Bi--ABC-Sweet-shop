# Project-report-from-data-analysis-Power-Bi--ABC-Sweet-shop
I am currently learning data analysis. I joined a free class with Dr. Karim Mohammed Rezaul sir a few days ago. As part of my Power BI assignment, I created this dashboard and identified key insights.

To see the dashboard, click here: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTM0Njc0OTctMDliYS00Y2E5LWJjZGQtNmQ3MWFjNDlkMzM0IiwidCI6IjUxMTJjMTM3LTllMWYtNGQzZS1iMTQyLWFiOWFmYzQ0OTAxYyIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D

As we can see from the Dashboard here,

1. Australia received most of the shipped boxes which is about 33k. Highest demand

2. The highest revenue was achieved in January.

3. Australia generated the highest revenue along with high shipping volume. 50% Dark Bites is the highest-selling product.

Notes: This is my first dashboard, so I got help from AI to write a sample report for it. So now and onward, the articles you read are AI generated. After a few practice sessions, I’ll be able to write better reports, in sha, Allah.
